Project Vision Understanding

Bookify is "The Operating System for Global Education" - we're not building just another e-reader or study application.
We're building an all-inclusive platform that will:

• Change the way students interact with learning material
• Provide publishers with a secure licensing model for the AI era
• Establish an adaptive learning platform that personalizes education at scale
• Pave the way for royalty tracking with AI source attribution
